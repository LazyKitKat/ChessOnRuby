## Chess on Ruby

This is my project for TOP's Ruby course final assignment. 

# How to run

To run this game, you'll need to install ruby. Then just type the following into your terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/LazyKitKat/ChessOnRuby
    cd ChessOnRuby
    ruby main.rb

# How to play

First, you'll need to choose if you want to load or start a new game. 
Then you'll be in the game, where you switch turns.

Each turn consists of choosing either a figure to move and its destination (selecting fields is done by tiping a letter, followed by a number, eg. "A2"), or castling (which is done by typing c while selecting a figure).

Modules for en passant exist, as well as promotion which is done when the pawn reaches it's end destination.
